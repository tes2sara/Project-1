# Project-1

This project is part of my Bachelor's thesis artefact. It involves performing proportional analysis, chi-square test analysis, and building an interactive dashboard to communicate the statistical analysis findings. 
The data is gathered and cleaned by Arda Durmaz, PhD, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Translational Hematology & Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic and Case Western University.
The data is collected from the following sites:
1. https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/
2. https://cellmodelpassports.sanger.ac.uk/
3. https://www.cancerrxgene.org/

The dashboard can be accessed by running the whole jupyter notebook.
